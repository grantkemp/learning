# learning
This Repos is a repository for my IOS Nanodegree Projects that show my progression during the course. 

## Reason for doing the IOS course
I really love working in mobile and think that mobile is an amazingly creative canvas that lets people make projects that can change industries, peoples' lives and connect with people in a much more personal way. 

During my career, I have had the fortune to work with some amazingly creative and talented developers.  One developer game me this advice:

**"Learn a new language or something new every year"**  

I thought that this was the year that I formalised some of my informal work, learning and turn it into something of a showcase.  

I started the Udacity experience, with a kid on the way, and a reluctant approval from my amazing, pregnant wife to give me space and time to do this course.  It was a really hard 8 months.  I would work weekends, on the train into work, lunchtimes even sometimes feeding the baby. Every moment I could get, I tried to get one step closer to the end. 

# What I actually learned.
I was aiming just to get the certification at the end of the course, but during the course I learned so much more: 
* Appreciation for code craftsmanship and letting others understand your code. 
* The power of design patterns and trying to do the most work in as little code as possible ( something I am still aiming for)
* The power of sharing, encouraging and helping others, whether it be fellow students, open source projects or even those really struggling to get help on places like Stack overflow.  With every share, I think I learned more myself. I plan to continue and encourage others to do so as well.  
* The final bit..and most important is to keep progressing. If you aren't sure if something will work, try it and you will always be able to iterate it.  Months from now, you will look back at the code and laugh at how bad it was, but remember it was that attempt that got you to your current state.  

## The Projects
- Initially I felt the projects were just hurdles to get over to get to the next set of lessons in the next course, but actually in doing them, I realised that they were lessons in there own right.   Every app or project that you do is always going to be that little bit of a learning lesson. 
- Before things like constraints would really frustrate me, but by the end of the Nanodegree,  I was using all the constraint types to create a pixel perfect ui in a fraction of the time.   
- Having 5+ app projects under your belt also gives you a great deal of confidence to go head first into other projects and look for other ways to learn.  
Most importantly, the projects though really cemented my knowledge and gave me more repetition to drum the knowledge in. I actually went back and did most of them  to exceed expectation standards as I really enjoyed the challenge and the learning that came from them.  If I had enough time, I would have done them all to perfection.

## Useful resources
The forums, and Google plus board were the most useful for me. It gave me a way to really ask detailed questions and since the re-organisation of the forums- they are actually useful. The people on the board are always really knowledgable and do a great job of pushing you in the right direction. 

###Here are the rules that I will take away from this course: 
**( besides the certification)**
- Don't be embarrassed to learn and show you are learning. Everyone is to some degree. 
- Keep progressing, not in big leaps but try to do "smaller steps" more regularly. 
- Find the time  and space to do the work. Even if you don't think there is, then try make time.  I had a newborn kid during the course, and I would sometimes be watching the training videos whilst I was bottle feeding the kid at 4am. 
- Make sure you get support from those around you- my wife and family have been amazing at giving me the space to learn. 
- Practice, Practice and Practice - don't just follow the videos, make sure you do the readers notes too.  You will learn a lot and gain even more. ( even if the topics may seem tough) 

### Note to myself and others 
I really enjoyed my experience with Udacity.  I learned so much.   
I hope to find ways to continue to learn, continue to innovate and most importantly, keep making things a little better, in small steps and constantly improving, through helping others and continue to iterate my craft.  

##What’s next
Now that I have a good deal of experience having built a large number of apps - I have begun to realise  how much more there is to master.  From the github exercises, I got a taste of contributing to open source and learned a lot from doing that as well as enjoyed helping and working with others.  

There are a couple of ideas for apps that I want to do myself and I also want use my skills to build some apps for our customers at work, but most of all I want to create some really game changing experiences. 

I want to use what I have learned to build really creative and exciting apps that connect with people and help them.  And most of all I want to keep on improving and learning.  

## Final thoughts
I created this post as I hope that in the future, I will help others and myself to keep pushing the boundaries of their own knowledge and what's out there.  I have no idea how to finish this post, barring to leave a quote.  Mainly because I am not done with learning yet.
