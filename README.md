# learning
This Repos is a repository for my IOS Nanodegree Projects that show my progression during the course. 

## Reason for doing the IOS course
I really love working in mobile and think that mobile is an amazingly creative canvas that lets people make projects that can change industries, peoples' lives and connect with people in a much more personal way. 

During my career, I have had the fortune to work with some amazingly creative and talented developers.  One developer game me this advice:

**"Learn a new language or something new every year"**  

I thought that this was the year that I formalised some of my informal work, learning and turn it into something of a showcase.  

I started the Udacity experience, with a kid on the way, and a reluctant approval from my amazing, pregnant wife to give me space and time to do this course.  It was a really hard 8 months.  I would work weekends, on the train into work, lunchtimes even sometimes feeding the baby. Every moment I could get, I tried to get one step closer to the end. 

# What I actually learned.
I was aiming just to get the certification at the end of the course, but during the course I learned so much more: 
* Appreciation for code craftsmanship and letting others understand your code. 
* The power of design patterns and trying to do the most work in as little code as possible ( something I am still aiming for)
* The power of sharing, encouraging and helping others, whether it be fellow students, open source projects or even those really struggling to get help on places like Stack overflow.  With every share, I think I learned more myself. I plan to continue and encourage others to do so as well.  
* The final bit..and most important is to keep progressing. If you aren't sure if something will work, try it and you will always be able to iterate it.  Months from now, you will look back at the code and laugh at how bad it was, but remember it was that attempt that got you to your current state.  

###Here are the rules that I will take away from this course: ###
**( besides the certification)**
- Don't be embarrased to learn and show you are learning. Everyone is to some degree
- Keep progressing, not in big leaps but try to do *smaller steps more regularly.*

### Note to myself and others ###
I really enjoyed my experience with Udacity.  I learned so much.   
I hope to find ways to continue to learn, continue to innovate and most importantly, keep making things a little better, in small steps and constantly improving, through helping others and continue to iterate my craft.  

##Conclusion##
I left above, as I hope that in the future, I will help others and myself to keep pushing the boundaries of their own knowledge and what's out there.  I have no idea how to finish this post, barring to leave a quote.  Mainly because I am not done yet with learning yet.

**Here are some inspirational quotes to help keep improving - whether its coding or anything else: **
